  Veneers are typically made from composite resin or porcelain, both of which
  can yield excellent results. The choice between these materials depends on
  several factors, including the patient’s goals, diagnosi s, case selection,
  budget, and the technical skills of the dentist.
</p>

<p>
  Composite veneers offer several advantages over porcelain. They can be
  fabricated during a single visit, are generally more cost-effective, and often
  require less invasive, and potentially reversible, prepar ations.
  Additionally, composite veneers can be easily repolished, touched up,
  modified, or repaired over time, ensuring clinical longevity and addressing
  common issues like staining. This versatility makes them an appealing option
  for many patients.
</p>

<p>
  The main disadvantage of composite veneers is that their aesthetic outcome
  relies heavily on the skill and dexterity of the dentist. The freehand
  application technique requires the dentist to create the corr ect shape,
  anatomical features, and tooth positioning without the support of a matrix or
  pattern. After application, the composite material must be polished to achieve
  a natural, tooth-like appearance. As a res ult, direct composite veneers have
  always presented a challenging technique for dental professionals.

  The VeneerNow System: Procedure and Application
</h2>

<p>
  VeneerNow features a customizable, prefabricated injectable matrix system
  designed to match each tooth’s anatomy. This system enables dentists to create
  durable, aesthetically pleasing veneers with precision and minimal manual
  intervention. By using injectable, flowable composites within a pre-sized
  matrix, VeneerNow ensures efficient application without air bubbles or
  inconsistencies. Additionally, the matrix del ivers excellent anatomical
  shape, requiring little finishing after light curing.
</p>

<p>
  The VeneerNow process is straightforward: the practitioner selects the
  appropriate matrix size, positions it on the tooth, and injects the composite
  resin material into the matrix mold. The design of the mat rix ensures that
  the composite flows evenly and precisely, helping to reduce the need for
  adjustments or corrections. This system results in a veneer restoration
  completed in a fraction of the time required for traditional freehand
  techniques.
</p>

<p>
  The VeneerNow Injectable Matrix System provides full anatomic, single-use
  matrices for maxillary teeth Nos. 5-12 in two sizes: small/medium and
  medium/large. Each mold includes an injection stalk for easy pl acement of the
  flowable composite tip. Designed to be closed at both the lingual and cervical
  facial margins, the matrix allows for quick and straightforward injection of
  the composite. Additionally, the matric es feature side wings for enhanced
  stability and reduced interproximal cleanup.&nbsp; The side wings are
  0.05mm-0.07mm thick, helping to gently separate the teeth to maintain
  interproximal contact.

</p>

<h2 id="case-example">Case Example</h2>

<p>
  A 70-year-old male patient presented to the dental office with a chief
  complaint: a broken porcelain labial veneer on tooth No. 8 that he wished to
  have replaced immediately. He reported no pain or sensitivi ty but was
  concerned about the esthetics, especially since he was attending his
  granddaughter’s wedding in the coming days. To address his needs, the
  VeneerNow system was selected to deliver a fast, beautiful, one-visit
  restoration. After successfully administering local anesthesia, the remaining
  porcelain veneer was removed. The tooth was minimally prepared, and the
  appropriate VeneerNow matrix was chosen (Palmer No tation System upper right

  />, size M/L). Phosphoric acid etch was applied to the e ntire preparation,
  followed by the application of a universal adhesive.
</p>

<p>
  The VeneerNow matrix was seated and stabilized with finger pressure. The
  mesial, distal, and lingual incisal portions of the matrix were then sealed
  with Venus ART Diamond Flow composite in shade A2. Next, t he Venus ART
  flowable composite canula was inserted into the facial stalk of the VeneerNow
  matrix, and the material was dispensed to fill the entire space, forming the
  veneer restoration. After light curing, th e matrix was removed, and the final
  restoration was finished and polished to achieve a lustrous result that
  matched Tooth No. 9. The patient’s occlusion was checked and verified, and
  upon reviewing the final re sult, he expressed extreme satisfaction.
